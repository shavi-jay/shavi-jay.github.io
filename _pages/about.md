Welcome to the website! I am a third-year PhD student Statistics and Machine Learning at Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, supervised by Prof. [Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/) and Prof. [Ruth Misener](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rmisener/).

Prior to this, I did my undergraduate and masters in mathematics at University of Cambridge, Trinity College,  followed by a masters in computational statistics and machine learning at University College London.

These are the things that interest me at the moment:
- Uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models
- Bayesian interpretations of In-context Learning
- LLMs for scientific discovery - especially in chemistry and drug discovery
- Reliability, interpretability and explainability of foundation models
- AI safety and alignment
- Cool maths

I am always open to collaborations and discussions. Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn.
